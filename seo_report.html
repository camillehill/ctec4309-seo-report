    <h1>SEO Report</h1>

    <!--Part 1: Summary of Report-->
    <h2>Summary of Report</h2>
    <p>SEO, or search engine optimazaton is the science behind how businesses get ranked on search engines such as
        Google or Bing. We will walk through Smile Ninja's current organic ranking, factors that affect it, and
        reccomend changes that can be made to the website to improve the organic ranking of the business. In addition we
        will make reccomendations outside of the scope of the website ot improve SEO.</p>

    <!--Part 2: Organic Ranking of Search Results-->
    <h2>How is Organic Ranking Determined?</h2>
    <p>Organic ranking search results are shown based on what was searched for or the search query. </p>

    <h3>Factors that influence organic ranking are:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>user location</li>
        <li>backlinks (websites that link to Smile Ninja's website)</li>
        <li>internal link structure</li>
        <li>structure of content</li>
        <li>amount of media content</li>
        <li>technical factors (such as load times, length of URL, etc)</li>
    </ul>

    <!--Part 3: Keywords and Current Ranking-->
    <h2>Smile Ninja's Current Ranking</h2>
    <p>Based the purpose, goals, and the services that Smile Ninja provides the </p>

    <h2>Keywords</h2>
    <p></p>

    <!--Part 4: Analysis of Current Web Pages-->
    <h2>Anaylsis of Current Website</h2>
    <p>SmileNinja’s current website is quite sloppy in terms of SEO. Many of the title tags are similar to each other
        and lack the keywords you would like to see in a site optimized for SEO. Not only this but some of the most
        important information on the website is buried underneath images, leading to keywords and headings coming after
        images in the website. Description tags as well are not defined and are lacking keywords that would help improve
        search engine ranking. Some things that the site has done well include making sure the most important title tags
        include keywords like “Dentist”, “Fort Worth”, “Children’s Dentistry”, and their services. To improve, it would
        be beneficial for the website to ensure they aren’t missing any title tags or meta description tags, and to make
        webpages for important keywords like their location, services, and the doctors who work there.</p>

    <!--Part 5: Inbound Links and other SEO Reccomendations -->
    <h2>Inbound Links and Other SEO Reccomendations</h2>
    <p>The current amount of inbound links is sitting around 6, most of SmileNinja’s competitors are closer to around
        600.
        These competitors include fortworthdental.com, tillmansmiles.com, and myidealdental.com. Our SEO goal for
        SmileNinja is
        to at least increase inbound links to 30, and we can do this by adding the site to many free publications where
        you can
        add links to your site for free, such as Crunchbase. We can also build our inbound links by featuring our
        website on
        social media like Facebook/Instagram. We will also review the backlink resources utilized by our competitors to
        reclaim
        broken links and establish ourselves on the same services to generate inbound traffic. Aside from just inbound
        links, we
        can also increase our SEO ranking by embedding videos into the site where we can and applying schema markup to
        our pages
        so the search engine understands what our site is trying to do better.</p>

    <!--Part 6: Traffic Boosting Ideas-->
    <h2>How to Boost Traffic</h2>
    <p>One way that SmileNinja could boost traffic to both their website would be considering advertising in social media spaces such as Facebook and Instagram. SmileNinja could adopt a dedicated content delivery strategy to engage customers across social media platforms by creating posts daily that incentivize communication and engagement. Encouraging shares and comments will allow for the friends of customers to locate business and increase traffic to the website. Another option for traffic increase would be for SmileNinja to greatly increase it's infrastructure for providing and sharing customer reviews for their services. Sending out satisfaction surveys and offering incentives for customers who share and fill out the survey would boost traffic through recommendations.</p>
